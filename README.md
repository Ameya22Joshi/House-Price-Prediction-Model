I have built an end to end Machine Learning Project that predicts the price of houses based on certain parameters like location of the house, BHK , no. of bathrooms and square feet. The dataset I have used is imported from kaggle which contains the data of Bangluru. I have used Linear Regression for predicting the price.Also I have built a dashboard to show the results.
